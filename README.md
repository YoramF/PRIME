# PRIME
Prime numbers generator
This example improve the default prime generator algorithm by deviding each tested number only by prime numbers. This reduces the overl iteration number significantly
This improvement force the program to run in a single thread.
Also attahced a version of the program (not optimized to check only prime numbers but all numbers up to sqrt() of the tested number) that is multi trhreaded and take advantage on all available cores in the system.
it run fast, yet the optimized single threaded program is faster...
